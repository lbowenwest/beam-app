# Beam Calculator Web App (WIP)

Runs a flask webserver to present app (once the front end is built I am still learning JavaScript)

Backend uses numpy and scipy to generate and analyse a simple beam from JSON data.

## Todo

- Add support for Macaulay's method
- Fix sign conventions
- Add a more robust api for the second moment of area finder
